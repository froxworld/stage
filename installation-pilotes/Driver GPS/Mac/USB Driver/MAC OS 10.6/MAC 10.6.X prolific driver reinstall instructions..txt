If your MAC is not able to recognize our USB GPS Receiver, PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEPS VERY CAREFULLY!

Have your USB GPS device unplugged and open up your Hard Drive folder and go to System/Library/Extensions folder and search for "ProlificUsbSerial.kext" and DELETE that file. Then restart your computer.

Then after the restart, reinstall the driver "PL2303_1.4.0.dmg" from ( http://www.usglobalsat.com/store/download/62/pl2303_1.4.0.zip ), which is the USB driver for Mac OS 10.6.X. After the install, it will ask you to restart the computer again. 
 
You can reference this document on how to install the driver ( http://www.usglobalsat.com/store/download/57/br355_gps_mac_v2.0.pdf ).
 
After your computer is restarted, then plug in the USB GPS Receiver and use our GPS Utility to test your USB GPS Receiver: 
( http://www.usglobalsat.com/store/download/62/mac_gps_utility_v2.zip ).
 
Configure the application settings to the following:

 
Port: /dev/cu.usbserial
Rate: 4800
Units: Miles
 
Let us know if you are still having issues. Thanks.
